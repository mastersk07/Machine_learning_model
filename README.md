**Titanic Survival Prediction**
This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning models.The dataset used is from the Kaggle Titanic competition, and the project involves datapreprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Project Overview**
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, and family size. The following steps are performed:

Data Loading: Load and inspect the Titanic dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Train multiple classifiers including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Submission: Generate predictions on test data and save results to a CSV file for submission.
